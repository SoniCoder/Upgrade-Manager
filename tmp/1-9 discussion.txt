//For invalid/valid check ila gave table user_constraints whereas gaston gave user_objects

//Also while connecting as a certain user only that user's constraints are shown.

//For the count checks a whole lot of tables don't exist for the migration that Ila provide and those tables only belong to a certain user.

And how many sort of migrations do I have to handle?
