Make sure you have gone through the Task System docs for properly understand this doc.

Every Step of the Procedure may produce certain logs which needs to be check for any king of errors. The error handling module of this tool
is responsible for doing such activities. After while performing a task inside the run function, at the end needs to be enter a function which
specifies while files need to be checked for errors.

The error handling module abstracts everything to two helper functions:

1. find_errors(filepath, patterns)

This function checks a single file for errors of the type specified in the patterns list. It will also report them in the error console and the error box.
This function also passes the error to the current error block which is reponsible for sending mails.

2. findErrorsInFiles(BACKUPFILES, taskobj)

This function uses the above function to quickly check errors in a bunch of files located in the standard log folders specified in a list.
