While creating a task you need to do certain steps to make sure any errors inside log files are handled correctly.

Basically you need to specify exactly which files you need to check for errors. 
This needs to be done in the runtask function inside the relevant opcode elif (Read Task System for further details).

1. Decide what all log files the task creates and which you wish to check for errors.

2. Copy those files using safecopy function to the appropriate log folder (See pre-written tasks for help).

3. Now call findErrorsInFiles and pass the list of names of log files.

4. Finally if this function returns True set current Task's status to 4.
