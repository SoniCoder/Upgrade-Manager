Whenever the program is run, a new folder is created inside the "archives" folder present in the program folder.

This archive folder is guaranteed to be unique and is named using the date and time at which the program was run.

Any useful logs created during the migration procedure are meant to be placed inside this folder in an organized manner.

The archive folder contains sub-folders for each phase of the migration and each phase folder contains all the schemas involved during migration.

From the code, the archive folder is accessible via globs.ARCHIVEFOLDER variable which can be used after importing globs module.
