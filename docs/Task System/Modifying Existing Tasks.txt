Read (Steps to create a new task) and open the part where it says "run function".

Basically you will need to go to the Task class, find the runtask function and the appropriate task using the op code.

The opcode can be found using the prepareTasks() method, this is where all tasks are created.

Once you have the op code, you can do whatever you want under the runtask function.
