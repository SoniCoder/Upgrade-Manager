globs.py is a file shared across all modules in the program.

This module acts as a configuration module where you can make changes at a single places available to be used throughout the program.
The module also acts as a place for sharing data among different modules of the program.

An example configuration would be the mail options. Refer to the mailing doc for more info on these.

Almost all the code uses this module to create global variables.

These variables need not to be written in globs.py as they can be created during runtime. 
For example, globs.a = "hi". Now globs.a is available throughout all modules that import globs.
