After encountering any error it is immediately send via mail to the recipient specified in the configuration file (globs.py) unless MAIL_ON is set to False inside globs.py.

All the configurations related to mail functionality can be found in globs.py module.

The following is a sample template:

MAIL_ON = True
ATTACHMENTS = []
SUBJECT = "Sample Subject"
FROM = "Hritik.Soni@jda.com"
TO = "f2014480@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in"
TEXT = "Sample Content"
SERVER = "mailout.jdadelivers.com"
PORT = "25"
PASSWORD = ""
COMPRESS = True
USE_TLS = False

MAIL_ON globally enables or disables the mail functionality.

ATTACHMENTS, SUBJECT, TEXT will be handled dynamically.

SERVER needs to be the SMTP server address hosting the mail functionality.

For JDA Port is 25 but make sure you are using the right port(its 587 for gmail).

Set COMPRESS as True if you want to compress files before they are sent otherwise set it to False.

USE_TLS needs to be True for servers that require TLS authentication, for JDA it needs to be set to False.
If USE_TLS is False, the password needs not to be specified but must be specified if TLS is enabled.

The Error-Mail Functionality uses net.py module for sending mails and to store errors pertaining to a single task, the ErrorBlock class is used. 
Whenever a new task is run, a new ErrorBlock object is created which will keep track of any incoming errors and throws a mail when task is finished and one or more errors were encountered.
